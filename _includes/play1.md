##### PLAY 1
## Understand what people need

We must begin digital projects by exploring and pinpointing the needs of the people who will use the service, and the ways in which the service will fit into their lives. Whether the users are members of the public or government employees, policy makers must include real people in their design process from the very beginning. The needs of people — not constraints of govern- ment structures or silos — should drive technical and design decisions.
We need to continually test the products we build with real people to keep us honest about what is important.

#### checklist
1. Conduct lightweight user research before development begins
2. Spend time with current and prospective users of the service, and use a range of qualitative and quantitative methods to determine these users’ goals, needs, and behaviors
3. Document the findings about user goals, needs, behaviors, and preferences
4. Share findings with the team and agency leadership
5. Create a prioritized list of user stories, which are short descriptions of what goals the user is trying to accomplish
6. Test prototypes of possible solutions with real people, in the field if possible

#### key questions
- What user needs will this service address?
- Why does the user want or need this service?
- Who are your key users?
- Which people will have the most difficulty with your service?
- What research methods were used?
- What were the key findings from users’ current experience?
- How were the findings documented? Where can future team members access the documentation?
- How often are you testing with real people?
